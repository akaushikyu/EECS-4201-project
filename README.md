# EECS-4201-project

This is the main repository for YorkU's EECS 4201 course project that progressively builds a fully-pipelined 5-staged in-order RISC-V core that supports the RV32I instruction set.
SystemVerilog is the hardware descriptive language (HDL) used to implement the core.

## Project structure

The project is divided into *6 project deliverables* (PDs). Each PD focuses on building a portion of the core culminating into the final pipelined implementation delivered in PD5.
Please refer the READMEs for each PD below for a detailed description of the implementation expected in the deliverable.

- [PD0](project/pd0/docs/README.md)
- [PD1](project/pd1/docs/README.md)
- [PD2](project/pd2/docs/README.md)
- [PD3](project/pd3/docs/README.md)
- [PD4](project/pd4/docs/README.md)
- [PD5](project/pd5/docs/README.md)

## Getting started

## Build and testing infrastructure

For each PD, a set of scripts are provided that compile, simulate, and test the hardware design. 
These scripts can be found under each PD's directory (`pd*/verif/scripts`). 

For each PD, there are specific test cases that the design must
